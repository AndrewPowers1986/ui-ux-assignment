        <p><b>Name:</b> Beebop Rocksteady</p>
        <p><b>Technology:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>PC, iPhone</li>
                <li>casual user</li>
                <li>loves the convenience of looking up any curiosity on the go</li>
                <li>hates when technology tries to help too much (i.e. spell correcting or auto-completing searches with off-the-wall suggestions)</li>
                <li>somewhat suspicious of being monitored</li>
            </ul>
        <p><b>Attitudes/Needs:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>uses Reddit to be notified about entertaining articles or posts related to his interests</li>
                <li>to search, and - failing that - to post, for technical solutions or niche, in-the-weeds questions about video games</li>
                <li>has a need for information, which he could figure out for himself if he spent enough time, but prefers to learn from the experience of others</li>
                <li>as much as he hates when technology tries to help too much, he finds unintuitive UI extremely frustrating and will abandon a platform with a steep learning curve</li>
